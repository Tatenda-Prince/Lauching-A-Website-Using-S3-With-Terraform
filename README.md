# Introduction

Hello everyone! I'm still motivated to improve my skills with AWS, and today I decided to give S3 a try at establishing a website. For those who do not know, S3 is a storage service that provides security, scalability, and data availability. Any company, regardless of size, may utilise S3 to safeguard its data for any use case, including data lakes, cloud-native apps, and mobile apps. Furthermore, it provides many storage classes, like Infrequent Access, Intelligent-Tiering, and Glacier, to mention a few.

In this project, I used Terraform and Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 to set up a straightforward and effective method for hosting a modest website. This project's primary goal is to demonstrate how to easily and automatically develop and launch a website.

I built a blueprint for the AWS S3 architecture required to host the website using Terraform. This made it simple for me to organise and automate the setup and management of all required resources.
